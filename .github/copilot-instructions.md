# Smart Spending Summary App

This is a React application built with Vite and TypeScript that analyzes credit card transactions using the OpenAI API and displays spending summaries with charts.

## Key Technologies:
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- TailwindCSS for styling
- Axios for API requests
- OpenAI GPT-3.5 for transaction analysis
- Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 for data visualization

## Project Structure:
- `/src/components` - React components
- `/src/types` - TypeScript type definitions
- `/src/data` - Mock transaction data
- `/src/utils` - Utility functions including OpenAI integration

## Guidelines:
- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper TypeScript typing
- Follow TailwindCSS utility-first approach
- Handle async operations with proper error handling
- Use modern ES6+ syntax
